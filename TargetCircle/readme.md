# Neural Network Fun

##Inspired by Coding Train here are some little projects with the toy-neural-network from Coding-Train

- The [Toy Neural Network ] (https://github.com/CodingTrain/Toy-Neural-Network-JS) can be found here...

# Projects

## Target Circle

### Inital Upload

In Target Circle the NN let small balls jump, the target is to keep the ball inside of the target circle.

If balls leave the canvas they get removed from the balls array. After 1000 frames a new generation with a
copy of fittest balls NN will be created. And the cicle repeats.

### Left Right Steering

NN can move balls left and right. Target circle stays static.

### Moving Target

Target is moving randomly

## Todo:

- [] Move target circle by mouse and make NN follow target

* [] Find more ideas...
